# borgesGPT
A tiny gptlike model with transformer architecture trained with the complete works of Jorge Luis Borges (&amp; other Authors, in spanish).  

This is a small language model made for eduactional purposes. My intention with this repo is to keep track of the improovements that I make while creating
my first language model. Including modifications of the dataset and the architecture. 

The basics of this model are taken from the fantastic video on building a GPT by Andrej Karpathy:
